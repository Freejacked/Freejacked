I live in a trailer park renting a single wide moblie home, its a one bedroom trailer and I have 14 roomates. I dont go out much as I might miss something on TV.
I have a really bad drinking and drug problem, no job, no money, no car and no goals in life other than I am single and looking for that special some-one.
I only have two felony convictions, one for domestic battery and the other for stalking.
If you have a car, we could date,,, or if you could loan me money for the bus I could get to your house.
I have a bicycle but it only has one seat and the tire is flat
